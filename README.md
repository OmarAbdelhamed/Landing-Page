# Landing Page Project

## Technologies used to create the project: HTML, CSS, Javscript.


In this project I tried to do my best to have a compatible environment inspired by videos and the documentations.
I made a page with sections and navigation bar every element in the navigation bar could be clicked and send the user direct to the clicked section name.
With the section name in the navigation element and the section highlighted when in view port.
then I addded an extra bottun to go all the way up in the page.
